How it works?

1. Click the right mouse button
2. Select the "Download Video" option
3. Wait for a moment and voila, the video is downloading

IMPORTANT!

- After installing the extension, you should restart your browser or at least browser tab.
- When you are trying to download video from the "Watch" section, first you need to scroll down a bit to let the extension properly load. This only occurs on that page.
