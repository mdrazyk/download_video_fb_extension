# Download video from facebook

This plugin extends the facebook context menu and adds functionality for downloading the selected video element.

You just simply

1. Click the right mouse button
2. Select the "Download Video" option
3. Wait for a second and voila, the video is downloading

## IMPORTANT!

After installing the extension, you should restart your browser or at least browser tab.
