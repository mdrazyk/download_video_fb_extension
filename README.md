# Video Downloader

Chrome plugin that adds video download functionality

## How does it work?

1. Right-click on the Facebook video element
2. Click the "Download Video" button
3. Wait for a while for the video to start downloading

## IMPORTANT! After installing the extension, you should restart your browser or at least the browser tab.
